Inter Font local hosting instructions

This folder contains `Inter` font files in woff2 format (for example: `Inter-Regular.woff2`, `Inter-Medium.woff2`, `Inter-SemiBold.woff2`, `Inter-Bold.woff2`).

The DinoX website served from `docs/` uses these files for local font hosting.

To update the fonts:

- Download the latest Inter release from https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases
- Extract the required `*.woff2` files from the archive
- Replace the files in `docs/fonts/` and commit the changes
