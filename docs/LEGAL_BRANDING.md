**Date**: November 21, 2025  
**Analysis for**: rallep71/dino fork

---

## ⚖️ License Analysis

### Current Situation

[DONE] **License**: GPL-3.0 (same as upstream)
- **What this means**: You MUST keep GPL-3.0 license
- **Why**: GPL-3.0 is "copyleft" - derivative works must use the same license
- **Result**: [DONE] Correct - You can't change the license

### Copyright

**Current**: "Copyright © 2016-2025 - Dino Team" (in About dialog)

**Legally correct for a fork**:
```
DinoX
Copyright © 2016-2025 - Dino Team (original authors)
Copyright (C) 2025 Ralf Peter
Copyright © 2016-2025 - Dino Team (original authors)
Copyright © 2025 - Ralf Peter (fork maintainer)
```
```

**Recommendation**: [DONE] Update the About dialog to show both copyrights

##  Logo & Branding Analysis

### Can You Use the Dino Logo?

**Short Answer**: [WARNING] Legally yes (GPL-3.0), but NOT recommended

**Why**:
1. **Trademark Risk**: 
   - "Dino" name might be trademarked (need to check)
   - Logo could have separate copyright/trademark
   - Could cause confusion with upstream

2. **Best Practice for Forks**:
   - Create your own visual identity
   - Makes it clear it's a different project
   - Avoids legal disputes

### Recommendation: Create New Identity

**Option 1: Subtle Rebrand**  **Recommended**
- Name: **"DinoX"**  (chosen)
- Logo: Modified version (change color, add badge/icon)
- Tagline: "Community fork with extended features"
- Keep "based on Dino" attribution

**Option 2: Full Rebrand**
- Name: Completely new (e.g., "Xabber Desktop", "Converser", etc.)
- Logo: Completely new design
- More work, but cleaner separation

**Option 3: Keep Everything** [WARNING] Not Recommended
- Risk of trademark complaints
- User confusion
- Credibility issues

**Search for**:
- "Dino" (messaging/software)
